# Big-Tech-Layoffs-2020-2024-
Studying how and why major tech companies (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.) reduced their workforce, and what impact it had.
This project analyzes the causes and financial impact of major layoffs across Big Tech companies between 2022 and 2024.
Using Excel for data cleaning, SQL Server for data analysis, and Power BI for visualization, the project explores layoff trends, affected industries, and workforce reduction patterns.
Insights reveal a significant spike in 2023 due to post-pandemic cost corrections, economic slowdowns, and the adoption of automation technologies.
The Power BI dashboard presents key KPIs (Total Layoffs, Average Layoff %, Workforce Reduction %) and interactive visuals by company and industry.
Recommendations focus on sustainable hiring, employee reskilling, and transparent restructuring to minimize future workforce disruptions.
